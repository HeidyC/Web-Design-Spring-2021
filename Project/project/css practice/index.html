        <p> During quarantine, I've been pretty busy. I've leaarned 5 songs on my ukulele and it's really fun.
            I've also been drawing my own characters and anime characters. I also love making video edits and
            editing photos. Overall, quarentine has been keeping me pretty busy.
        </p>
